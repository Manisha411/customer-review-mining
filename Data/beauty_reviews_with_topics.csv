Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.","Not for Everyone, but I love it.",,,Want300,when they first announced the kindle oasis i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation kindle paperwhite just as i felt when they announced the voyage i read a lot so my kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time i have never had an issue with battery life i have only had it get really low a few times typically when i was traveling so again i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasis as the reviews for the oasis came out i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot especially when i was in a seated position this slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions i had some other minor issues with my paperwhite like when reading in the dark i couldn t find an adjustment for the light that i preferred 5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than i needed i decided to pass on the voyage because i really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option now that i have the oasis i definitely think it was worth it for me i really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the paperwhite it provides the same reading experience although i did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older paperwhite which is a plus the oasis is really comfortable in my hand which helps me forget that it is there when i was holding my paperwhite with my left hand at times i would accidentally go back a page which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience i have the black model because it was the only option available unless i was willing to wait a few more months the build quality of the oasis and its case is very nice just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it the only concern i have is how well it will protect the kindle i will update the review if i find this to be a problem i loved my paperwhite and i will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time it definitely is great and the better buy but i am glad i decided to order the oasis the reduced weight ergonomic design and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them.

I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so.",Great value for the money!,,,Jordan,i have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now i went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale i m originally an apple guy but my ipad has seen better days the tablet is nestled in compact packaging inside you will find the sync cable charger and the tablet itself it comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag it looks pretty good quality and feels great in my hands it is very easy to grasp with one hand leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do the setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions if you are already an amazon customer you will be asked to input your information during setup making it even easier to get started the picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet it s not hd but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks amazon s app store is packed with tons of apps movies books etc there is definitely plenty to choose i have access to amazon videos store and everything amazon at the palm of my hands the only downside to the tablet is that amazon uses its own silk browser which i am not a very big fan of i tried to see if i could download chrome but that is still not an option hopefully it will be some time in the future the browser is a bit slow in certain web pages but functional another thing that i found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e mail account to the tablet the only thing that i notices was that it took a while to load my account but the setup is very easy you have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands overall this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet it may take some folks a some time to get use to amazon s os but it should not take very long to do so,0,Hydration/Moisture

It's light weight (my iPad weighs a ton), it's easy to download and access books, you can read on tons of platforms. I have been using an app called ""Overdrive"" to check out ebooks from the library. Now I don't have to get in my card and drive to my local library. I can just browse from my home via my smart phone. If you enjoy reading and your thinking about getting a kindle please do! It's the best purchase I've made in a long time!

Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading.

I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!",EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS,,,Jamie,when i made this purchase it was for what i thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to amazon unlimited music i plugged it in and the setup was a breeze i was able to get the amazon unlimited music at a great price only 3 99 mo if used only on an echo product and the quality amazed me then i was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands and spoke loudly a command to play music from one of my playlists and the amazon echo actually heard me correctly from three rooms away so i started checking this item out a bit more it now turns on my tv i already had a harmony hub can use it to change channels turn on roku etc with just a few other smart home gadgets this amazon echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands it can control a thermostat turn on a coffee pot the possibilities seem endless when i purchased this echo i had no idea it did so much you know what else it can do it can order items through amazon by voice add reminders to my calendar make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar if you have a large home you can pick up an amazon dot which allows you to access your smart home devices when the amazon echo is at the other end of the house forget to turn off the living room tv and you re already snug in your bed amazon echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the harmony hub want to set an early morning alarm just ask the amazon echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice having trouble falling asleep ask amazon echo or dot to read one of your kindle e books or play some relaxing music all in all an excellent product that not only makes life easier but fun,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo. Nothing personal but it doesn't make sense since there's a box to enter the ""name"".

I had thought the AI would be much better than it is. Sometimes you need to say something three times for Alexa to find it. For example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it. This is with voice training complete mind you. I purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house. They did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos. Be warned though if you ask Alexa to play your group (multiple echos) you cannot play all your devises at once using Spotify for example. Verbally asking Alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music. The Alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate. I feel Im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone. You need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back. I think most have the intention of buying the Echo, setting it up, and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup. Remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle. I gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank. I think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems Amazons priority isnt necessarily the Echo. From reviews Ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release. I was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if I would have paid full price I would have returned all three and saved my money. Wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product.",Getting Better,,,tyostrike,having realistic expectations is a must with the echo i had thought the ai would be much better than it is sometimes you need to say something three times for alexa to find it for example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it this is with voice training complete mind you i purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house they did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos be warned though if you ask alexa to play your group multiple echos you cannot play all your devises at once using spotify for example verbally asking alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music the alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate i feel im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone you need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back i think most have the intention of buying the echo setting it up and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle i gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank i think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems amazons priority isnt necessarily the echo from reviews ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release i was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if i would have paid full price i would have returned all three and saved my money wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

I was amazed at how cool and useful the Alexa system can be. We were using one Echo Dot to make lists, check the weather, set calendar appointments, set alarms, and even play rainstorm soundtracks to help sleep at night. My birthday was just a couple of weeks ago and my wife got me the Echo as the main Alexa hub in our living room. The built-in speakers sound pretty good for what they are. Definitely a huge improvement over the Dot's built-in speaker, but even the Dot has a nice sound for as small as it is. We now have 4 Echo Dots and the Echo to control all sorts of WEMO switches and outlets around the house. We already had a NEST thermostat which integrated nicely and easily. The best thing is that Alexa understands all of our different voices... even our 4 year old. He can now turn his bedroom light on by asking Alexa to do it so he doesn't have to be afraid of the dark! It really is a very cool and convenient system. My wife thought it was silly at first, but she actually loves it. It's great for playing your iHeart Radio and Pandora stations too!",Just Plain Awesome!,,,BRGKW,i actually started with an amazon echo dot to see how the whole thing worked without having to spend a lot of money i was amazed at how cool and useful the alexa system can be we were using one echo dot to make lists check the weather set calendar appointments set alarms and even play rainstorm soundtracks to help sleep at night my birthday was just a couple of weeks ago and my wife got me the echo as the main alexa hub in our living room the built in speakers sound pretty good for what they are definitely a huge improvement over the dot s built in speaker but even the dot has a nice sound for as small as it is we now have 4 echo dots and the echo to control all sorts of wemo switches and outlets around the house we already had a nest thermostat which integrated nicely and easily the best thing is that alexa understands all of our different voices even our 4 year old he can now turn his bedroom light on by asking alexa to do it so he doesn t have to be afraid of the dark it really is a very cool and convenient system my wife thought it was silly at first but she actually loves it it s great for playing your iheart radio and pandora stations too,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results.","So far, so good, with a couple of caveats!",,,StarBender,i opted for the echo over the dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker and because i planned to add dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants the speaker sound is not great but it s not the worst i ve heard i ve also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit the echo was easy to set up and is really easy to use i especially like the ability to create a shopping list although i wish i could create more than one list without adding apps and to easily integrate my google calendar i m currently exploring other features and skills for the system some of which are very entertaining and useful one disappointment is the limitation of the near field voice recognition range alexa may be always listening but her ears don t seem to be very good if i m more than 15 20 feet or one room away with not walls between us she usually doesn t pick up my commands that not withstanding she recognizes commands very well and is very pleasant to interact with another issue i discovered is that in order for the echo to access your spotify music service at all you have to subscribe to the premium version i can understand that given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them however with amazon music you can access the free version and their premium amazon prime version in the area of smart home capability i purchased a philips hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights and was able to get them set up in the app very easily alexa does a great job of controlling them for us but i am disappointed that the only place i can find additional bulbs seems to be online where i have to pay for shipping in addition to tax apparently the retailers best buy walmart home depot etc haven t seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted i ll be adding other devices as time progresses and expect to be pleased with the results,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day.

Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it.

The only thing that would make it better would be if I could call it Jarvis when I speak to it. I would totally feel like Iron Man. Once you setup your iHeart Radio, Pandora Jam and Amazon Prime - your music possibilities are endless. It will also give you news headlines, weather, wake up alarms, etc. You can teach it skills such as telling jokes, random pick up lines or even pootering on demand. My kids love that it has a quite extensive poot library. (something I never thought i'd say) One warning! It gets expensive quick. I had it two days and was already back at Best Buy buying a Phillips Hue Starter Kit so I could control my bedroom lights by voice. Not mention that you can order using Amazon Prime by voice.

The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life.

By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more","The Echo's Little Sister Is AMAZING!! 3,",,,Deanokat,important update 3 8 17 as you read my original review please be aware that amazon announced in early february 2017 a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owners to enable a hands free option by going into settings in the alexa app you can now choose the hands free option and have your tap respond to voice commands without touching it just like the echo and echo dot this is a fabulous development and something tap owners have been hoping for thank you amazon since the lack of hands free operation was the one major shortcoming of the tap this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better one thing to keep in mind though especially if you use your tap on battery power the hands free mode will drain the battery more quickly because it requires the microphone to be on at all times but since you can easily toggle between hands free or regular tap mode using the alexa app you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and convenience i admit that i was a little skeptical when amazon first introduced its echo device but i decided to buy one anyway thinking that if i didn t like it i could easily sell it after all back in the early days of the echo it was in very high demand so the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal today as an avid music listener who loves to cook i m thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try i had wanted a device that i could stream music with in the kitchen and the echos hands free voice control made it very appealing but how would it sound that question was quickly answered as soon as i set up and started using my echo read more,1,Irritation/Sensitivity

We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Since we use Prime and Amazon Music, its a no-brainer for us to use the Fire TV. Everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly.Edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews:If you are a first-time cord-cutter, considering cord-cutting or new to streaming TV services, here are a few things to keep in mind.1) Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting. Just google ""cord cutting"" to get started with several good articles. I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc. Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content. They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch. If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable.2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection. This is very important. We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company. We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV. So make sure yours can as well. If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds.3) Some apps require a cable subscription. You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps. For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed. So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want.4) Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface. It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide. But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide. Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs. Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect. Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote.",Great buy for cable cutters,,,TechieNerd,cord cutter here we had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone since we are prime members we finally decided to give amazon fire tv a shot we ve been using fire tv for two weeks now and we ll never go back to cable pros ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space simple remote and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote no buffering issues have yet come up although that may be because i have a very strong internet connection seamless interaction with our prime video account and amazon music across all devices for example if i download a movie from prime on my tablet watch some of it during my commute when i get home and turn on fire tv i can pick up right where i left off from my tablet seamlessly without having to manually sync comes with thousands of channels apps loaded including all of the the major services we use can be used for games we haven t tried any games yet the voice command feature is outstanding speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it with multiple options for buying renting or just viewing for free if available i ve never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit using the amazon photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your fire tv for large screen viewing of your photos cons no way to customize the home screen layout at least no way that i ve been able to figure out overall i m kicking myself for not doing this sooner since we use prime and amazon music its a no brainer for us to use the fire tv everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews if you are a first time cord cutter considering cord cutting or new to streaming tv services here are a few things to keep in mind 1 make sure you really take the time to do research and due diligence on cord cutting just google cord cutting to get started with several good articles i m seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like netflix hulu etc fire tv and all of the other streaming services like roku apple tv etc do not just give you free access to all content they allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch if you do it right you ll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable 2 make sure you have a strong and fast internet connection this is very important we dumped our cable company in its entirety including internet service and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company we have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming fire tv so make sure yours can as well if you re not sure call your internet service provider tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds 3 some apps require a cable subscription you can purchase a streaming service like sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps for now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but i suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed so do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want 4 give yourself time to adjust to the new interface it took some getting used to when i lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide but the fact is i m no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide rather than surf i m turning to specific apps to watch specific programs its liberating in a way that i didn t expect besides i can now surf all of the amazon prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote,0,Hydration/Moisture

I made the decision to cut the cable when Sling TV started providing the ESPN family of channels on its app. But the question was: which device to get. I was already an Amazon Prime member and had a Netflix subscription. So I needed to find a device that had those apps, plus Sling and Hulu. Amazon Fire TV and Roku 3 were the only devices to carry all the apps that I was using and wanted to use. I read many reviews and both devices seemed to be good. So I rolled the dice and got the Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to connect to my TV and Home Network. I was up and running in under 5 minutes. Haven't missed cable tv for a single minute. I like Amazon Fire TV so much that I got a 2nd unit for another television in the house. With a good HD antenna and streaming media device, you will never miss cable! Best of all, I am now saving over $100/month.",Cutting the cable made painless,,,BatonRougeBill,amazon fire tv is a great media streaming device i made the decision to cut the cable when sling tv started providing the espn family of channels on its app but the question was which device to get i was already an amazon prime member and had a netflix subscription so i needed to find a device that had those apps plus sling and hulu amazon fire tv and roku 3 were the only devices to carry all the apps that i was using and wanted to use i read many reviews and both devices seemed to be good so i rolled the dice and got the amazon fire tv it was super easy to connect to my tv and home network i was up and running in under 5 minutes haven t missed cable tv for a single minute i like amazon fire tv so much that i got a 2nd unit for another television in the house with a good hd antenna and streaming media device you will never miss cable best of all i am now saving over 100 month,0,Hydration/Moisture
